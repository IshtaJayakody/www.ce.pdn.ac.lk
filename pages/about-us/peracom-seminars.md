# Peracom Seminars

<div class="text-justify">
  <p>
    Peracom Seminars is a series of seminars hosted by the Department of Computer Engineering, University of Peradeniya, since May 2021. These seminars aim to inspire undergraduates and promote collaborative research by connecting students with leading industry professionals, academics, and researchers from around the world. With a focus on cutting-edge research and technological innovations in computer engineering and related fields, the series has successfully fostered engaging discussions and knowledge sharing among participants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each seminar lasts approximately 1-1.5 hours, with 40 minutes dedicated to the speaker's presentation followed by a 20-minute interactive Q&A session. Our audience primarily consists of undergraduate and postgraduate students in fields such as Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical and Electronics Engineering, along with academic staff members. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Peracom Seminars are typically conducted online via Zoomâ„¢ to facilitate participation from international guest speakers. However, we also encourage physical seminars whenever possible, as they offer a more interactive experience between the speakers and the audience.
